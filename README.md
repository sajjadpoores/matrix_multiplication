# Matrix Multiplication
- This function is the most simple implemented algorithm for 2 matrix multiplication which runs in ***O(N*M*P)*** , where size of the first matrix is ***NxP*** and size of the second matrix is ***PxM***.
- If you pass wrong sizes (first matrix's columns must be  same as the second's rows in size) to the function, it will return ***false*** otherwise true.Which means the multiplication has being done perfectly.
- If we pass two square matrices with the size ***nxn*** , the time complexity would be ***O(N^3)***.
